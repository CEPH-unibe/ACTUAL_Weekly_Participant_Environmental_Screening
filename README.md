# ACTUAL: weekly screening of the participant environmental and personal data

Author: Tino Schneidewind


### I answer the following questions in this App:

1. Who has been monitored per week/time-period? 
2. Which files are available per person?
3. What were the exposures of each person of the week?
4. Create a pdf-file for every time period that enables me to check what data is missing and if there are some major irregularities.
